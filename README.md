## ðŸ”— Dependency

This addon **requires** [`nampower`](https://github.com/pepopo978/nampower) and [`superwow`](https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperWoW).

_Nampower is needed for instant spell queuing and zero-lag rotations.  
SuperWoW is needed for efficient buff fetching without the use of GameTooltips.
Please ensure both are installed before use._

---

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

1. Download the addon folder and place it into your World of Warcraft interface addons directory:
    ```
    Interface/AddOns/MageControl
    ```
2. Install [`nampower`](https://github.com/pepopo978/nampower).
3. Install [`superwow`](https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperWoW).
4. Restart WoW.
5. Use `/mc options` to set up the actionbar slot numbers of Fireblast, Arcane Rupture and Arcane Surge (this is absolutely required, addon won't work otherwise). Slots are counted by bars. Bar 1 is Slots 1 to 12, Bar 2 is Slots 13 to 24 etc.
6. Optionally, you can change settings for base haste (talent and gear, should be about 10% with most arcane gear. Does not have to be totally exact). Haste Threshold is the value at which haste percentage the addon won't use Arcane Surge in standard rotation anymore since it is GCD based and doesn't profit. 25 - 30 is recommended.
7. Use `/mc unlock` to move the CD Buff Duration Frames to the place you want them to be. See below for a list of frames with explanation.
8. Use `/mc lock` to lock them in place. They will only show if the buff is running
9. Done!

## ðŸ“¦ Buff Duration Frames
- `Arcane Power`: Shows Arcane Power Buff with remaining duration
- `Mind Quickening`: Shows the Mind Quickening Buff with remaining duration (upon using the Mind Quickening Gem trinket)
- `Arcane Rupture`: Shows the remaining Rupture Debuff duration
- `Wisdom of the Mak'aru`: Shows stacks and duration of the [`Sphere of the Endless Gulch`](https://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=55501)
- `Enlightened State`: Shows the 20% haste buff of [`Sphere of the Endless Gulch`](https://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=55501) once you collected 8 stacks of `Wisdom of the Mak'aru`

Please Note: You can have `Wisdom of the Mak'aru` and `Enlightened State` at the same time, so putting those 2 frames on top of each other is not recommended. I might add functionality in the future to unify this.
