# MageControl Improvement Plan

## Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive improvement plan for the MageControl addon based on an analysis of the current codebase and the requirements documented in `requirements.md`. The plan is organized by functional areas, with each proposed change accompanied by a rationale explaining its benefits.

## 1. Core Rotation Enhancements

### 1.1 Advanced Haste Scaling
**Proposed Change:** Implement dynamic spell priority adjustments based on more granular haste thresholds.

**Rationale:** The current system uses a single haste threshold (default 30%) to determine whether to use Arcane Surge. A more granular approach with multiple thresholds would optimize DPS across a wider range of gear levels and buff combinations. This would make the addon more adaptable to player progression.

### 1.2 Encounter-Specific Optimizations
**Proposed Change:** Expand the specialized rotation support beyond Incantagos to include other key raid encounters.

**Rationale:** Different boss encounters have unique mechanics that may benefit from tailored spell priorities. By adding more encounter-specific optimizations, players can maximize their performance in various raid scenarios without manual adjustments.

### 1.3 Clearcasting Utilization Improvement
**Proposed Change:** Enhance the logic for Clearcasting proc utilization to prioritize the highest-value spell based on the current combat situation.

**Rationale:** Currently, Clearcasting procs are used for Arcane Missiles when Arcane Rupture is active. Adding situational awareness to use Clearcasting for different spells depending on the combat context (AoE vs single-target, movement phases, etc.) would increase overall DPS and mana efficiency.

## 2. User Interface Improvements

### 2.1 Enhanced Buff Display Customization
**Proposed Change:** Add more customization options for buff displays, including size, transparency, and text formatting.

**Rationale:** Players have different UI preferences and monitor setups. More customization options would improve usability across various display configurations and allow better integration with other UI addons.

### 2.2 Visual Spell Queue Indicator
**Proposed Change:** Implement a visual indicator showing the next spell in the rotation queue.

**Rationale:** This would help players understand the addon's decision-making process and anticipate upcoming actions, improving the learning experience and allowing for better manual intervention when needed.

### 2.3 Consolidated Settings Panel
**Proposed Change:** Redesign the options panel to include all settings in a tabbed interface, including buff display settings that currently require slash commands.

**Rationale:** A unified settings panel would improve usability by providing a single location for all configuration options, reducing the need to remember slash commands.

## 3. Performance Optimizations

### 3.1 Buff Tracking Efficiency
**Proposed Change:** Optimize the buff tracking system to reduce CPU usage during intensive combat scenarios.

**Rationale:** The current implementation caches buff information for 0.1 seconds, but a more adaptive caching strategy based on combat intensity could further reduce performance impact during demanding raid encounters.

### 3.2 Memory Usage Reduction
**Proposed Change:** Implement more efficient data structures and reduce redundant variable storage.

**Rationale:** Lower memory footprint would benefit players with limited system resources and reduce potential conflicts with other addons.

### 3.3 Frame Update Optimization
**Proposed Change:** Implement variable update frequencies based on the importance of different UI elements and game state.

**Rationale:** Not all UI elements need to update at the same frequency. Critical elements like buff timers near expiration could update more frequently than stable elements, reducing overall CPU usage.

## 4. New Features

### 4.1 DPS Statistics Tracking
**Proposed Change:** Add a lightweight DPS tracking module that records performance metrics specific to Arcane Mage rotation.

**Rationale:** This would help players evaluate their performance and the effectiveness of different gear setups or talent choices, providing valuable feedback for improvement.

### 4.2 Trinket and Cooldown Integration
**Proposed Change:** Enhance the rotation logic to account for trinket procs and recommend optimal cooldown usage.

**Rationale:** Coordinating trinket usage and cooldowns can significantly impact DPS. Intelligent suggestions would help players maximize the value of these limited resources.

### 4.3 Mana Efficiency Analyzer
**Proposed Change:** Implement a post-combat analysis tool that evaluates mana usage efficiency and suggests improvements.

**Rationale:** Mana management is critical for Arcane Mages. Feedback on efficiency would help players improve their sustainability in longer encounters.

## 5. Code Structure and Maintainability

### 5.1 Modular Code Reorganization
**Proposed Change:** Refactor the codebase into more modular components with clearer separation of concerns.

**Rationale:** A more modular structure would improve maintainability, make future enhancements easier to implement, and potentially allow for feature toggling to customize the addon experience.

### 5.2 Improved Documentation
**Proposed Change:** Add comprehensive inline documentation and create a developer guide for the codebase.

**Rationale:** Better documentation would facilitate community contributions and make it easier for new developers to understand and enhance the addon.

### 5.3 Localization Support
**Proposed Change:** Implement a localization framework to support multiple languages.

**Rationale:** This would make the addon accessible to non-English speaking players and expand its user base.

## 6. Testing and Quality Assurance

### 6.1 Automated Testing Framework
**Proposed Change:** Develop a simple testing framework for core functionality.

**Rationale:** Automated tests would help catch regressions when making changes and ensure consistent behavior across updates.

### 6.2 Combat Log Analysis Tools
**Proposed Change:** Create tools to analyze combat logs for rotation efficiency.

**Rationale:** Data-driven optimization based on real combat logs would help fine-tune the rotation algorithms for maximum effectiveness.

### 6.3 Beta Testing Program
**Proposed Change:** Establish a structured beta testing program for new releases.

**Rationale:** Organized testing with dedicated testers would improve quality assurance and help identify issues before general release.
